		<!--After playing around in excel and failing to optimize beyond a four turn interval (including the use of if statements)
		I discovered someone had done something very similar in excel for MOO II. After trying in excel I thought it's just
		too complicated for excel to solve. But as you will see in the hyperlink below to the MOO II Decision Optimization
		it was more a matter of simplifying the questions I was asking. I highly recommend using the attached link below
		and fully understanding it's concepts and how they might be applied to this before continuing. Also greater knowledge
		is required of coding, computer science, AI decisions and algorithms and much much more. I just don't think
		what I am trying to do here can be effectively solved without much more in depth knowledge.

		<h1>Masters of Orion IV: Decision Optimization</h1>
		<h2>Factors that Play into Decision Making</h2>
		<p>Masters of Orion is a comprehensive strategy game involving many variables which impact the many paths to
			victory. While some paths to victory may seem subjective and hard to measure, all aspects of the game involve
			some mathematics. Some mathematics are much easier and important to discern than others. In the case of Masters
			of Orion IV diplomacy and espionage are shrouded in unknown equations and probabilities whereas production,
			population, finances, and science are much more observable, controllable, and in many respects more important.
			That isn't to say that ignoring espionage and diplomacy goes without consequence, but it is the economy of your
			empire that dirves it's success. Because of this my website will focus on the mathematical and relational
			aspects of these elements where they originate, colony management. Once the corresponding mathematical
			relationships are
			fully examined a marginal benefit vs marginal cost framework can be established to help determine which actions
			arrive at better outcomes. Once that is established then a framework that allows for patronization of certain
			factors
			(industry, population growth, science, ships, etc.) can be more fully extrapolated. The outcomes expressed here
			should be taken as
			advice and measures for decision making rather than a substitute for it as there are various
			factors colony management that drive an empire forward. </p>
		<h3>Colonies</h3>
		<p>Colonies are the centerpiece to Masters of Orion. They drive the economical, industrial and scientific
			capabilities of every empire. Indeed no player can win the game without having effective colonies to
			finance, build and progress their empire. Colonies have various aspects to them which interrelate in various
			ways. A break down into each of these aspects and how they relate to one another shown in the lists below. </p>
		<h4>Colony Foundations</h4>
		<p>These describe the attributes that come with each colony.</p>
		<ul class="colony-attributes">
			<li>Environmental Class: adjustable with runaway climage change or terraforming.</li>

		</ul>
		<h4>Population</h4>
		<ul class="colony-attributes">

		<h4>Poplulation Growth</h4>
		<ul class="colony-attributes">
			<li>Food Production</li>

			<li>Discovery of Related Technologies</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Security</h4>
		<ul class="colony-attributes">
			<li>Infrastructure</li>
			<li>Race Attributes</li>
			<li>Colony Leader</li>
			<li>Discovery of Related Technologies</li>
			<li>Spies Assigned to Counter Espionage</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Credits</h4>
		<ul class="colony-attributes">
			<li>Generated from Population</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Population Size</li>
				<li>Tax Rate</li>

		</ul>
		<p>One other element that can play a factor in almost all of these colony attributes is the successful carrying
			out of foreign espionage. I.e. sabotaging research, poisoning water supplies, manufacturing dissent
			etc. </p>
